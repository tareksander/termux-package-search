# Termux package search

A simple tool to search Termux packages and their info.  
Runs completely in the browser, and works offline after the first load and index download: https://tareksander.github.io/termux-package-search/  
Data is taken from the [Repology data](https://github.com/termux/repology-metadata), which is updated every 6 hours.  
Supports searching via containing substring, starting substring and general regex in the name, description and dependencies (for dependencies, each dependency is checked separately).
